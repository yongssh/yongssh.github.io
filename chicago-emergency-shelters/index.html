      <h1>Grievances Filed Against Chicago Emergency Shelters</h1>
      <p class="dek">
        When thousands of asylum seekers began arriving in Chicago in 2023, the city converted public buildings into
        Emergency Temporary Shelters. These sites, meant to be short-term havens, quickly became home for months at a
        time to families waiting for more permanent housing.
        By spring 2024, the City of Chicago began publicly reporting grievances filed from inside these shelters—formal
        complaints about conditions, staff, supplies, safety, and policy.

            In late October, the City announced that it would end its migrant shelter system by the end of the year.
            Mayor Brandon Johnson announced that services would be merged with the city's homeless shelters.
            According to Block Club Chicago's <a
              href="https://blockclubchicago.org/2024/10/21/city-closing-migrant-shelter-system-by-end-of-the-year/">coverage</a>,
            13 active shelters run by the city and state housed 4,996 people, with 21 awaiting placement, at the time of
            the story.

            On November 20th, the City announced the imminent demobilization of the New Arrivals system in

            Of the 12 then-operational New Arrival shelters, they planned to reduce the number to five&mdash;three run
            by the city and two by the state&mdash;and close the remaining seven by the end of the year, following their
            previous plan.

          <p>
            They also announced that there were three shelters that would “remain open and merge into the unified
            shelter system”: American Islamic College (AIC), Young Women’s Leadership Academy (YWLA), and the
            Metropolitan Water Reclamation District (MWRD).
